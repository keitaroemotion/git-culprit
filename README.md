# Culprit

git wrapper to find the author quickly and easily


# Installation

```
$ ./installer
```

# Usage

The command is used such as:

```
$ culprit jpmorgan --author=moomin --month=Jan
```

In the example above, what we are looking for is the branch `remotes/origin/jpmorgan-product-server-routing` such that the argument without `--[key]=` does function as the keyword query to find out the part of branch namespace.
